Implementation of Sorting, Searching, Graph creation on Blockchain data

Implemented sorting and searching on Blockchain data and created a graph corresponding to the data.
Each node in the graph was a user public key, and edges were the transactions. Several graph algorithms were applied (Dijkstra, Topological sort, DFS, BFS, ...).
